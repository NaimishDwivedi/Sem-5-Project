          <h2>Types of Complexity</h2>
          <p>
            Complexity in algorithms refers to how the resource requirements
            (time and space) grow with the size of the input:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Time Complexity:</strong> Measures the amount of time an
              algorithm takes to run as a function of the size of the input. It
              indicates how the running time increases with input size.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Space Complexity:</strong> Measures the amount of memory
              space an algorithm requires to run as a function of the size of
              the input. It indicates how the memory usage increases with input
              size.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Both types of complexity are crucial for evaluating algorithm
            performance and efficiency.

          <h2>Running Time Analysis</h2>
          <p>
            Running time analysis involves determining how efficiently an
            algorithm performs by examining its execution time under varying
            input sizes:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              It helps in predicting how fast an algorithm runs as the size of
              the input grows, which is critical for choosing the most suitable
              algorithm for a given problem.
            </li>
            <li>
              Methods of running time analysis include counting the number of
              operations or using asymptotic notations to describe performance
              in terms of input size.
            </li>
            <li>
              Common growth rates used in analysis include constant time,
              logarithmic time, linear time, polynomial time, exponential time,
              and factorial time.
            </li>

          <h2>How to Compare Algorithms</h2>
          <p>
            Comparing algorithms involves assessing their efficiency and
            performance characteristics:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Empirical Analysis:</strong> Running algorithms on real
              data and measuring performance metrics such as execution time and
              memory usage.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Theoretical Analysis:</strong> Using asymptotic notations
              like <code>Big-O</code>, <code>Omega</code>, and{" "}
              <code>Theta</code> to provide insights into algorithm efficiency
              and scalability.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Considerations:</strong> Algorithms can perform
              differently based on the type of input (best-case, worst-case,
              average-case), which should be considered when comparing their
              performance.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Choosing the Right Algorithm:</strong> Factors to consider
              include the problem constraints, input size, and expected
              performance requirements.

          <h2>Rate of Growth</h2>
          <p>
            The rate of growth describes how quickly the running time or space
            usage of an algorithm increases as the input size grows:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Understanding the rate of growth helps in determining the
              scalability and efficiency of an algorithm for large inputs.
            </li>
            <li>
              Common growth rates include constant time (O(1)), logarithmic time
              (O(log n)), linear time (O(n)), quadratic time (O(n^2)), cubic
              time (O(n^3)), exponential time (O(2^n)), and factorial time
              (O(n!)).
            </li>
            <li>
              Choosing algorithms with lower growth rates (such as O(log n) or
              O(n)) typically results in more efficient solutions for larger
              datasets.

          <h2>Types of Analysis</h2>
          <p>
            Algorithm analysis encompasses various approaches to understanding
            their performance:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Worst-case Analysis:</strong> Determines the maximum time
              or space required for any input size <code>n</code>. It provides a
              guarantee on performance under adverse conditions.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Average-case Analysis:</strong> Considers the average
              performance over all possible inputs, providing insights into
              typical algorithm behavior.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Best-case Analysis:</strong> Determines the minimum time
              or space required for any input size <code>n</code>, offering
              insights into optimal algorithm behavior.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Case-specific Analysis:</strong> Evaluates algorithms
              based on specific input patterns or scenarios that are relevant to
              the problem domain.

          <h2>Asymptotic Notation</h2>
          <p>
            Asymptotic notations are used to describe the limiting behavior of a
            function as the input size approaches infinity:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <code>Big-O (O)</code>: Represents the upper bound of the running
              time or space complexity of an algorithm. It indicates the
              worst-case scenario for algorithm performance.
            </li>
            <li>
              <code>Omega (Ω)</code>: Represents the lower bound of the running
              time or space complexity. It indicates the best-case scenario for
              algorithm performance.
            </li>
            <li>
              <code>Theta (Θ)</code>: Represents the tight bound, indicating
              both upper and lower limits and providing a precise
              characterization of algorithm performance.
            </li>
            <li>
              Asymptotic notations are essential for comparing algorithms and
              understanding their scalability and efficiency.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Big-O Notation</h2>
          <p>
            Big-O notation is commonly used to describe the upper bound of an
            algorithm's running time or space complexity:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              It provides an asymptotic upper limit on the growth rate of an
              algorithm, indicating how the running time increases with input
              size.
            </li>
            <li>
              For example, an algorithm with O(n) time complexity means its
              running time grows linearly with the size of the input.
            </li>
            <li>
              Big-O notation helps in evaluating algorithm efficiency and making
              informed decisions on algorithm selection based on performance
              requirements.
            </li>
          </ul>

        <section>
          <h2>Omega-Ω Notation</h2>
          <p>
            Omega notation represents the asymptotic lower bound of an
            algorithm's running time or space complexity:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              It defines the best-case scenario for an algorithm's performance,
              indicating the minimum time or space required for any input size.
            </li>
            <li>
              For instance, an algorithm with Ω(n) time complexity implies that
              its running time will not grow slower than linearly with input
              size.
            </li>
            <li>
              Omega notation complements Big-O notation by providing insights
              into optimal algorithm behavior under favorable conditions.
            </li>
          </ul>

        <section>
          <h2>Theta-Θ Notation</h2>
          <p>
            Theta notation denotes the tight bound of an algorithm's running
            time or space complexity:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              It establishes both upper and lower limits, providing a precise
              characterization of an algorithm's performance within a specific
              range.
            </li>
            <li>
              For example, an algorithm with Θ(n) time complexity means its
              running time grows linearly with input size, matching both the
              best-case and worst-case scenarios.
            </li>
            <li>
              Theta notation is useful for describing algorithms with consistent
              performance across all input sizes, offering a balanced view of
              efficiency.

          <h2>Asymptotic Analysis</h2>
          <p>
            Asymptotic analysis focuses on evaluating the performance of
            algorithms as the input size becomes very large:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              It helps in understanding how algorithms scale and perform under
              varying conditions, without getting into precise details of
              constant factors or lower-order terms.
            </li>
            <li>
              Asymptotic analysis provides a high-level view of algorithm
              efficiency using asymptotic notations like Big-O, Omega, and
              Theta.
            </li>
            <li>
              By focusing on the dominant term that determines growth rate,
              asymptotic analysis facilitates comparisons and selections of
              algorithms based on their scalability.

            <li>
              <strong>Space Complexity:</strong> Describes how the memory usage
              increases with input size. Algorithms with lower space complexity

            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Robustness:</strong> Reflects an algorithm's ability to
              handle unexpected or irregular inputs without failing or producing
              incorrect results.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Optimality:</strong> Considers whether an algorithm
              provides the best possible solution under given constraints, such
              as minimizing time or space usage.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Trade-offs:</strong> Algorithms often involve trade-offs
              between time complexity, space complexity, and other performance
              metrics. Choosing the right trade-offs depends on specific
              requirements and constraints.

            To estimate the running time of an algorithm, follow these steps:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Identify Basic Operations:</strong> Determine the
              fundamental operations within the algorithm, such as arithmetic
              operations, comparisons, and assignments.
            </li>
