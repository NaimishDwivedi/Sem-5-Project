      <h1>What is an Algorithm?</h1>
      <p>
        An algorithm is a finite sequence of well-defined instructions that can
        be used to solve a computational problem. It provides a step-by-step
        procedure that converts an input into a desired output.
      </p>

      <h2>How do Algorithms Work?</h2>
      <p>Algorithms typically follow a logical structure:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Input:</strong> The algorithm receives input data.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Processing:</strong> The algorithm performs a series of
          operations on the input data.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Output:</strong> The algorithm produces the desired output.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Characteristics of an Algorithm:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Clear and Unambiguous:</strong> The algorithm should be
          unambiguous. Each of its steps should be clear in all aspects and must
          lead to only one meaning.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Well-defined Inputs:</strong> If an algorithm says to take
          inputs, it should be well-defined inputs. It may or may not take
          input.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Well-defined Outputs:</strong> The algorithm must clearly
          define what output will be yielded and it should be well-defined as
          well. It should produce at least 1 output.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Finiteness:</strong> The algorithm must be finite, i.e. it
          should terminate after a finite time.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Feasible:</strong> The algorithm must be simple, generic, and
          practical, such that it can be executed using reasonable constraints
          and resources.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Language Independent:</strong> Algorithm must be
          language-independent, i.e. it must be just plain instructions that can
          be implemented in any language, and yet the output will be the same,
          as expected.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>What is the Need for Algorithms?</h2>
      <p>
        Algorithms are essential for solving complex computational problems
        efficiently and effectively. They provide a systematic approach to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Solving problems:</strong> Algorithms break down problems into
          smaller, manageable steps.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Optimizing solutions:</strong> Algorithms find the best or
          near-optimal solutions to problems.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Automating tasks:</strong> Algorithms can automate repetitive
          or complex tasks, saving time and effort.

        <li>
          <strong>Test and debug:</strong> Execute the algorithm with various
          inputs to ensure its correctness and efficiency.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Analyze the algorithm:</strong> Determine its time and space
          complexity and compare it to alternative algorithms.
